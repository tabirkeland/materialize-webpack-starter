# Materialize Webpack Starter

## Overview
This starter template utilizes [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com/) and [Laravel Mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix).  Laravel Mix is a Webpack 2 wrapper that provides a good starting point for working with the package bundler.

## Installation
Simply clone and run `npm install`.

## Usage
All the available commands are in `package.json`:
* `npm run dev`
* `npm run watch`
* `npm run hmr`
* `nmp run production`

To tailor this package, modify the `wepback.mix.js` and `webpack.config.js` accordingly.  Most use cases are explained [here](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix/tree/master/docs).
